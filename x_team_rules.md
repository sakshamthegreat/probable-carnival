# X-Team 01 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

Team will communicate in person, or on GroupMe about what tasks they wish to work
on, and based on this, tasks will be assigned. Team members may also say how confident
they feel doing their respective assignments, and can request for additional team members
to work with them. If any conflicts come up regarding members wanting to do the same task,
the team leader will step in and resolve issues.

Tasks will be reviewed on a biweekly basis (read: twice a week on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 4 p.m.), 
and as tasks get completed responsibilities were be readjusted to give
each team member as similar amount of work.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

As stated in the previous section, tasks will be reviewed on a biweekly basis to
track progress. After each task is completed, it will be reviewed by at least one
other team member to make sure that the code works correctly, is easy to read,
and is commented correctly. If these conditions are met, then the task will be
marked as completed and all parties involved will move on. If this not the case,
then the team members working on said task will have to fix code to resolve
complaints. If a dispute comes up, the team leader will step in and resolve the
issues.


## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

Any difficulties in a task should be communicated at the biweekly reviews, so that
the team can work with that team member to either give said member more asistance,
or to reassign a different task to said team member (only to be used if absolutely
needed). If any team member is having a particularly hard time on a task, or is really
struggling with the tests, he or she can immediately post to the GroupMe so that other
team members can work to help ease the difficulties the team member is facing.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Transparency and Communication are the name of the game here. If a team member is having
trouble with something, he or she should communicate these issues to make everyone aware
so that problems aren't left unsaid, therefore resulting in the team suffering as a whole because nobody addressed it.
Everyone needs to communicate at all necessary times, and all communication needs to be open
and honest. Failure to do this will cause degredation of code quality, and deterioration of
teamwork. Therefore, always always speak your mind regarding the project, and speak it honestly.
